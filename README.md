Handy Haskell
=============

Couple of lines of Haskell code that I just like keep at hand.

Code here is usually started as "too small/unimportant to get its own repository".
It can be viewed as kind of a kindergarten for my Haskell code.
Needless to say, some of it already grew beyond that and should be carved
out.

[Handy](handy)
--------------

Code that was originally supposed to be in this repository. It is documented using
Haddock ([pre-generated documentation](http://xkollar.github.io/handy-haskell/handy/)).
There are some general-purpose functions that I found myself coding times
and again when solving puzzles like those on
[IBM Ponder This](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/index.shtml),
[Jane Street Puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/), or [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

[HLint](hlint)
--------------

My configuration of [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint) and example integration with GHCi.
If you do not have your own `~/.ghc/ghci.conf` then simply put those files
into `~/.ghc/` directory to get `:hlint` available from GHCi. (It will get you
nicely colored hints for your code (if any `;-)`).

[Irc](irc)
----------

Little something to monitor IRC channels without the risk of posting something accidentally.

[Other](other)
--------------

Actual code used to solve some of mentioned puzzles.

[Svg-graphic-teach](svg-graphic-teach)
--------------------------------------

Toy graphic library with [its own documentation](svg-graphic-teach).
