Handy Haskell
=============

Couple of lines of Haskell code that I just like keep at hand.

Code here is usually started as "too small/unimportant to get its own repository".
It can be viewed as kind of a kindergarten for my Haskell code.
Needless to say, some of it already grew beyond that and should be carved
out.

Handy
-----

Code that was originally supposed to be in this repository. I try to
comment it using Haddock. There are some general-purpose functions that
I found myself coding times and again when solving puzzles like those on
[IBM Ponder This](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/ponderthis/index.shtml),
[Jane Street Puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/), or [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

HLint
-----

My configuration of [HLint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint) and its integration with GHCi.

Irc
---

Little something to monitor IRC channels without the risk of posting something accidentally.

Other
-----

Actual code used to solve some of mentioned puzzles.

Svg-graphic-teach
-----------------

Toy graphic library with [its own documentation](svg-graphic-teach).
