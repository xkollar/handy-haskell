=================

This simple library was created with one thing in mind:
To give students with hearing disability something to play
with in introductory course on functional programming.
Somethink they can read and understand, without many
dependencies. Something that give students feeling they
do beautifull and interesting stuff.

It was inspired by the book *The Haskell School of Expression*
by *Paul Hudak*.

You won't be disapointed if you use it only as a toy `;-)`.

This is the latest version I was able to find on my hard drive.
If you happen to posses newer version, I'll gladly update it here.
